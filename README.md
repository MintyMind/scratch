University Information for Foreign Students - HTML & CSS Webpage

Project Overview:
This project is a simple informational webpage with highly visual content designed to provide essential details to foreign students from Turkey who are planning to attend to University of Hertfordshire. The webpage includes general information about the university, the campus environment, living costs, and accommodation alternatives.

•	Living Costs: Information about the expected living expenses for students, including rent, utilities, and general cost of living in the UK.
•	Accommodation Options: Lists different types of student accommodations (on-campus, off-campus, private housing) with pros and cons for each.

Tech Stack:
•	HTML: The structure and content of the webpage are built using HTML5.
•	CSS: Styling is done using external CSS to create a clean and responsive design that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
