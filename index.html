                    <p class="hommie" id="hisp1">The Hertfordshire University (UH) has a history of nearly 70 years. The city of Hatfield, where the university is located, was home to the aviation industry, especially during World War II. Hertfordshire University was founded in 1952 as a technical college providing education in mechanics, aviation and natural sciences. It gained university status in 1992.</p>

                    Today, there are approximately 32,000 students studying at Hertfordshire University. Almost a third of them are international students. This rate is higher in postgraduate programs. International studets are from a wide range of diverse countries besides the Indian population is bigger proportionally. Turkish students can be described rare in quantity and Turkish people in Hatfield are not much as well. There are many programs such as undergraduate, postgraduate, coursework and diploma. Mentioning about the Hertfordshire University programs and their requirements here is uncoherent with the purpose of this page. Since business administration is the masters' I am studying, I have only added the current (03/09/2024) status of Business School of Hertfordshire University accreditations. My aim is to give a general idea about the topics that you may have difficulty finding information about.

There is Subway, Starbucks and outdoor cafes on the campus. The “Hutton Hub” building, which houses other units such as the medico, student union and career office, is also on this campus.

The “Sports Village” building on the campus has facilities such as an indoor swimming pool, climbing platform, and fitness center that can be used by those outside the university with a membership. Right next to the campus the university’s grass sports fields are located.

            <div class="section">
                <p>One of the most important problems you need to figure out is the accommodation in Hatfield. We can say that there are basically 3 options in this regard. Hertfordshire University accommodation, private student accommodation and room for rent in Hatfield. Each has its pros and cons, but ultimately the priorities of the person who will make the decision will be the determining factor. First-time students usually prefer to stay in an on campus accommodation at first and then rent a room in the same house with other students in Hatfield.</p>
                <div class="grid_box" id="grid_dh">
                    <figure id="fig_img54"><img id="img54" src="images/img54.jpeg" alt="wa"><figcaption>Flat corridor (de Havilland, on campus accommodation) </figcaption></figure>

                </div>
                
                <p class="hommie">The best part about university accommodation is that it is close to the classrooms on campus and you can get quick responses from the accommodation office and the company which runs the place when you have any problems. The downsides are that the area of the rooms are small and the room price is above average. It can be said that the rooms in College Lane are a bit bigger in terms of square meters. Other good things are the international students environment, 24-hour security, laundry room and the mini fridge in the rooms only in de Havilland accommodation. The kitchens in all room types are shared on the flat. There is enough freezer space and cupboards where you can put your dishes, cutlary and so on. There are 2 toasters, stoves + oven, sinks, kettles, microwaves and a large dining table in each. You can find detailed information about room types, room prices and contract periods on the <a href="https://www.herts.ac.uk/life/student-accommodation/living-on-campus"> university's relevant web page</a>.</p>
                <div class="overwrite">
                    <figure id="fig_img58"><img id="img58" src="images/img58.jpeg" alt="luna"><figcaption>Luna student accommodation</figcaption></figure>
                    <p class="hommie" id="luna">The second alternative is to stay in a private dormitory off campus. A well-known private dormitory close to campus is <a href="https://www.crm-students.com/hatfield/luna?_yTrackUser=MTg1ODExMTIjNTg3NjEzOTk4-m%2f%2bIC0jXbUk%3d&_yTrackVisit=MjgyMDMyMjMjMTUwNTg1MzY3OA%3d%3d-%2bkbAMJ4tE6I%3d&_gl=1*uuzzbr*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU4NTU4NTgxNy4xNzI2NzkxODYw*_ga_L7HSGR93JP*MTcyNjc5MTg2MC4xLjEuMTcyNjc5MjA2Ni4wLjAuMA..">“Luna Student Accommodation”</a>. From what I heard from people who have stayed there, although the prices are similar to university accommodation, the physical conditions of the rooms with their privite kitchens are better.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p class="hommie">When life expenses in Hatfield and Hertfordshire Univrsity costs are taken into consideration, another option which is frequently preferred due to its affordability is a room for rent in Hatfield outside the campus. You can find an affordable room price in Hatfield that matches your budget. However the house prices in Hatfield are high, Hertfordshire University students are going after rooms for rent in Hatfield for really low prices. Furthermore, contracts are not seasonal, but usually for 6 months or 1 year. There are many different types of rentals for students in Hatfield. For those who come to the United Kingdom for the first time and have no connections here, it may be difficult to stay in a rented room as soon as they arrive due to the rental procedures. For the contract, you need to obtain documents for local taxation (Council Tax) through the university and a local guarantor. Again, it would be useful to browse a few <a href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/Hatfield.html">websites</a> that can help you to make up your mind. You can also go through the web pages of real estate agents in Hatfield such as <a href="https://www.strats-estates.co.uk">“Strats”</a>.</p>
                <p class="hommie">Apart from the above options, students studying in Hertfordshire university programmes without time constraints sometimes prefer to stay in areas outside of Hatfield where there is more mobility and more part-time job opportunities. In this case, it is necessary to take into account the high transportation costs in the UK.</p>

                        Before we move on to living costs in Hatfield, here is a quick reminder. The maximum amount of cash allowed on you while entering the UK is £1000. The commission rates for credit cards you bring from Turkey are high and you will be caught in the currency conversion spread. Therefore, one of the first things you need to do when you arrive is to open a bank account here and use the card linked to this account or an app like Apple Pay for your payments. There are banks that offer different advantages to international students. My choice was HSBC because it allows you to open an account without going to a branch, has no monthly rent and has low international money transfer commissions.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="hommie">
                    Although budgets vary greatly from person to person, a Turkish student's monthly living costs in Hatfield are around £1000-1200. If you can spare £1500 per month, it will be more than enough for you. The budget is consist of main life expenses in Hatfield such as accommodation, food, clothing/personal care, transportation and social activities.
                </p>
                <p class="hommie">
                    You can get an idea about the accommodation prices in Hatfield from the links I shared in the <a href="#heading_accommodation">“Accommodation”</a> section.
                </p>
                <p class="hommie">
                    Food prices are similar to Turkey. Surely, cooking your meals by yourself will be more budget-friendly. There are brands which you can shop for food from that appeal to different customer groups here. The cheapest “grocery shop” in Hatfield is Aldi. Asda is also a convenient and diverse grocery shop. When you first arrive in Hatfield, I recommend that you go to Asda to buy your needs in terms of price and variety. Tesco is a chain market with higher quality and relatively higher prices. Additionally, there is a plenty number of stores in the city center with different price ranges.

                        “Galleria” is the well-known shopping mall of Hatfield. It is within walking distance of Hertfordshire University. Restaurants, fast food, clothing stores, shoe stores, sports stores are available in Galeria.

                </div>
                <p class="hommie">
                    You can't find much variety of goods in Hatfield for your needs other than food. It would be better to shop in busy areas around Hatfield like St Albans, Watford and of course London. For clothes, you can consider "Primak" which is good in terms of price, quality and variety.
                </p>
                <p class="hommie">
                    Social life is roughly cheper than Turkey, but ultimately the upper limit depends on personal preferences. Unfortunately, Hatfield is a small city and rather silent. At first, you can try the social events in UH ​​and the organizations in the Forum. Places around like St Albans and Potters Bar, especially London, are much better than Hatfield in this regard.
                </p>
                <p class="hommie">
                    Transport fares are a bit expensive in the UK. If you use public transport regularly, you can travel much cheaper with subscription tickets. The frequency of buses, which are a subsidiary of UH <a href="https://www.unobus.info">“Uno Bus”</a> and other companies, is sufficient. Bus, train and metro (called "tube" in London 🙂) services can be disrupted from time to time due to reasons such as strikes and maintenance. Planing your journey in advance using applications, and checking <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk">TFL</a> can save some money and time.

                <p class="hommie">
                    With the Tier 4 Student Visa, you are allowed to work 20 hours per week. Although it may be difficult to cover all your expenses, it is an opportunity for additional income. Salaries are around £8-£15 per hour. You can find more detailed information about the legal framework on the UH "Studnet Immigration Team" when you arrive and on the <a href="https://ask.herts.ac.uk/student-visa-holders-working-during-your-studies">"AskHerts" website</a> beforehand.
